## OpenCV build tips by Todor

## Speed up build:

**Compile from/to RAM disks** (in Windows). **OSFMount, imdisk**, etc. Don't forget to format the new drives.

_(!!! Beware with imdisk and unmounting: unmounting one drive may delete the other ones as well! Is it a rule: IDKn, bt it hpnd. [:)] )_

## Storage

OCV 4.5.2 could be > 1.5 GB after built. (I don't know for rich builds with Gstreamer etc.).
Allocate ~ 2.0 GB for the built output drive.


```
CUDA_ARCH_BIN
3.0;3.5;3.7;5.0;5.2;6.0;6.1;7.0;7.5

```
--> Change to **just the target one**, if only for your current PC, this is the slowest part of compilation.

```
750 Ti: 5.0;
960: 5.2 
1070: 6.1
2060 Super: 7.5.
```

CPU dispatch: if you don't plan to use old CPUs, set the highest minimum.

Core 2 Quad: SSE 4.1
i5 2500, 3220M, 3470: AVX
Skylake: AVX2

Don't forget:

```
WITH_OPEN_GL
CUDA ...
OPENMP
DSHOW
D3D11 ...
...
```

Install gstreamer if needed:  (slow download, requires 1 GB+ if all is installed, 1.18)
https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/download/

Follow: https://galaktyk.medium.com/how-to-build-opencv-with-gstreamer-b11668fa09c
Windows: 
Set Path: (Start->Envir... ) “GSTREAMER_DIR” “C:\gstreamer\1.0\x86_64”
...

Install QT if you need it etc.

## Speed up build:

Compile from/to RAM disks (in Windows). OSFMount, imdisk, etc. Don't forget to format the new drives.

(!!! Beware with imdisk and unmounting! Unmounting one drive may delete the others as well (at least I've had such an issue). Imdisk allows to resize the disk, add more space when needed. )

OCV 4.5.2 built is 1.x GB (I don't know for rich builds with Gstreamer etc.). Allocate 1.5 - 2.0 GB for the built output.
